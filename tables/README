Each .sql file in this directory contains the commands needed to
populate the table in DOW given by the file name (e.g. aliens.sql
populates the alien table).

I've only included tables that do not contain any member-specific
information. It's also quite easy for me to generate these files
in another format if that's more convenient for you. Just let
me know.

   pg_dump -O -x -a -D -t $a dow | grep '^INSERT' >> $a.sql
