<h1>Miscellaneous DOW Policies and Information</h1>

<h3>Email</h3>

Please be sure to include your ship name if you email me. With so many
members, I can't always remember everybody's email address.

<hr><h3>The DOW front page</h3>

The official DOW front page is 
<a href="http://janin.org/dow/front.cgi">http://janin.org/dow/front.cgi</a>.
It contains important news and links
to recently added features. Please check it out occasionally.

<hr><h3>Anonymous Members of DOW</h3>

Because of several verifiable threats by big ships to begin attacking
DOW members on sight, membership in DOW is now by default completely
anonymous. You can change to being non-anonymous by going to your
<a href="http://janin.org/dow/ms.cgi">membership data page</a>.

<hr><h3>Yahoo Forums</h3>

Because of anonymity issues (see above), I am no longer using the
Yahoo Forums for DOW. Instead, I will be hosting the forums directly
on the DOW server at 
<a href="forumread.cgi">http://janin.org/dow/forumread.cgi</a>.

<p>Many topics are discussed on the forums. I especially suggest that
newbies join, as there are many quite knowledgeable posters.

<p>Currently, there are three forums:
<a href="forumread.cgi?-f+xeno">xeno</a>, for Institute of Xenology
members, <a href="forumread.cgi?-f+advice">advice</a>, and <a href="forumread.cgi?-f+general">general</a>, for
everything else. If more forums would be useful, let me know.

<hr><h3>DOW, Pirates, Purgers, Releasers, and the UPF</h3>

I created DOW specifically because I wanted an information sharing
system that did not welcome pirates and bullies. Information is a
valuable resource, and giving it away to captains who abuse other
ships just didn't seem right.

<p>Certain ships are permanently banned from DOW. I will not allow
them to join under any circumstances. These ships include UPF members,
chronic terminal purgers, and pirates. (Clarifying note: This list was
fixed shortly after DOW formed. No ships will be added or removed.)

<p>Other ships may be banned, but then pardoned if their behavior
changes. The procedure to ban a ship starts by nominating them for
banning on the DOW forum. After some discussion, I will post a
poll. After one week, the nominated ship will be banned if more
members voted for banning than against banning. A ship may be forgiven
using a similar method.

<p>With DOW now anonymous, I strongly suggest you consider who
<em>might</em> be a member, and propose bannings accordingly.

<hr><h3>DOW Conduct Rules</h3>

The only official rule is that you do not share DOW data with
non-members. But if you annoy enough of DOW, you will probably get
banned.

<hr><h3>Alliances and DOW</h3>

Alliances have no special status within DOW (e.g. no access to data
beyond what their members already have). However, I encourage members
to form alliances, and may provide scripting support if the alliance
is interesting.

<hr><h3>Out of Character</h3>

I really like the "evil" ships in the game. They add spice. Without
them, I probably would have quit in boredom. Instead, I'm doing
everything I can to fight them -- DOW is one prong of the attack.

<p>As long as the big, old ships continue to cooperate among themselves,
the only way small to medium ships can compete is by likewise
cooperating.

<p>For some of my random musings on DOW and TBG, see <a href="http://janin.org/~janin/tbg-dow.html">http://janin.org/~janin/tbg-dow.html</a>.
