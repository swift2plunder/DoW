OBSOLETE - There have been significant changes to the combat code since this was written.


TBG Combat Simulator

I did not write this code. The person who wrote it left the game long
ago, and has agreed to allow it to be released. He does not want to be
identified, however.

Please do not email me with questions, as I am not familiar with the
code (beyond how I integrated it with DOW).

I've removed all the code that looks up information in DOW and
replaced them with stubs. You'll mostly just have to fill in
URLs and file names.

The code has only been run on linux systems. I suspect it could be
made to run on others with some effort. You'll need at a minimum Perl
and a C compiler.
