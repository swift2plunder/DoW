I wrote DOW as a hobby and an excuse to learn about database, and the
code reflects this. I made lots of mistakes with both the schema and
the code, which I never corrected. Everything grew organically, with
no refactoring. As a result, the code is pretty hideous.

I would suggest taking a look at MISTAKES, which lists some of the
most obvious problems with the schema and code. The time to correct
the schema errors is before you start adding data!

In order to maintain DOW anonymity, I removed a bunch of code that
obfuscates who's a member. I also replaced a bunch of hard-coded paths
with "/Path/to/".

The file MANIFEST lists all the files and directories at the top
level, with a short explanation of what each file is for.


I've also included the dow2 directory, which contains an abandoned
effort at a new version of DOW. It corrects some of the mistakes, but
has some issues with efficiency.
